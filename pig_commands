>> dump sort;
>> fil = filter s by branch = 'AI';
>> dump fil;
>> group = group s by branch;
>> dump group;
>> s1 = load 'home/cloudera/file2.txt' using PigStorage(',') as (no:int,name:chararray,reg:chararray,branch:chararray);
>> dump s1;
>> sjoin = join s by no,s2 by no;
>> dump sjoin;
>> equijoin = join s by no,s2 by no;
>> dump equijoin;
>> leftout =  join s by no LEFT OUTER, s2 by no;
>> dump leftout;
>> rightout = join s by RIGHT OUTER,s2 by no;
>>dump rightout;

>> dump proj;







### WordCount using pig

>> pig -x local
>> stu = load 'file1.txt' using PigStorage(',') as (no:int,name:chararray,reg:chararray,branch:chararray);
>> dump stu;
>> token = FOREACH stu GENERATE FLATTEN((TOKENIZE(name));
>> groups = GROUP token by token;
>>dump grop;
>> count = FOREACH groups GENERATE group, count(token); 
>> dump count;
